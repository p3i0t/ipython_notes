    "In the most traditional buffer overflow exploit cases, hackers try to change the execution\n",
    "flow of the process and execute a new shell (\"/bin/sh\") with higher privileges by exploiting\n",
    "a exploitable process with higher privileges. When they do\n",
    "this, it is inevitable to call the execve syscall. The blog article will walk you\n",
    "through what exactly the execve syscall do both in the *c* level and *assembly* level.\n",
    "# What does execve do in *c* level\n",
    "Generally speaking, you can use execve to execute a new command. The way to call it is\n",

    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include <unistd.h>\n",
    "\n",
    "/**\n",
    " * filename: full pathname of the executable file, no PATH search is needed.\n",
    " * argv: all arguments of the command.\n",
    " * envp: leave it alone for now.\n",
    " * Both argv and envp should be terminated by a null pointer.\n",
    " * example: ls -a\n",
    " * filename = \"/bin/ls\", argv = {\"ls\", \"-a\", NULL}\n",
    " */\n",
    "int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[],\n",
    "           char *const envp[]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step of an attack is start a new shell, then the program in c will be\n",
    "like this (we leave the argument *envp* to be NULL here for simplification):\n",
